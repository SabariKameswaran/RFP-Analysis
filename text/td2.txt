1 IRT suggested laminated clear curved Glass 99 * 61 i.e. 2515mm*1550mm inches size with 8.76 mm thickness. It may be difficult

to accommodate the said width of 2515mm within the bus width of 2600-50mm unless the glass is wrapped around, that would
significantly increase cost and proneness to damage. Hence, IC suggested that the specified dimensions be maintained as size given
by IC is generally as per UBS II to facilitate standardisation and thus ease of availability at minimum cost for replacement.
2 IRT suggested Single toughened grey curved glass of 96 * 42 inches i.e. 2439mm*1067mm with 6 mm thickness. The suggested size
is a non- standard size. Whereas, size given by IC is generally as per UBS II to facilitate standardisation and thus ease of availability
at minimum cost for replacement.

1 IRT suggested laminated clear curved Glass 99 * 61 i.e. 2515mm*1550mm inches size with 8.76 mm thickness. It may be difficult

to accommodate the said width of 2515mm within the bus width of 2600-50mm unless the glass is wrapped around, that would
significantly increase cost and proneness to damage. Hence, IC suggested that the specified dimensions be maintained as size given
by IC is generally as per UBS II to facilitate standardisation and thus ease of availability at minimum cost for replacement.
